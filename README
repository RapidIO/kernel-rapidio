================================================================================

September 2, 2016 v1.0.0

================================================================================

Package Revision History
------------------------
v1.0.0 - Aligned with RapidIO subsystem code in mainline Linux kernel v4.8.
         New functionality: support for data buffers in reserved memory space.

v0.91 - Added automatic installation of RIONET driver into "make install".

v0.9 - Preliminary release (2016.01.29). Precedes patches submission to the
       upstream mainline code tree.

I. Overview
-----------

This Linux RapidIO driver package is "out-of-tree" variant of existing mainline
Linux kernel RapidIO subsystem including the most recent updates that may be not
available in stable kernel releases.

Primary purpose of this driver package is to bring up-to-date RapidIO solutions
to users of popular Linux OS distributions without forcing them to backport
RapidIO updates available in the most recent versions of mainline kernel.

See 'Documentation/rapidio' directory for detailed description of Linux RapidIO
subsystem.

This package should be used with Linux kernel versions 3.10 or newer.
It was tested on following Linux distributions:
- CentOS 7.2.1511 (kernel v3.10) (x86_64 and PowerPC POWER8)
- Fedora 20 (kernel v3.16.7)
- Fedora 23 (kernel v4.3 and mainline v4.4)

II. Building and Installation
-----------------------------

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
ATTN: Remove configuration file /etc/modprobe.d/rapidio.conf if upgrading
drivers from any preliminary version (< 1.0.0). Edit new configuration files
as required after driver package is installed.
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

1: Install a Linux OS distribution with kernel version 3.10 or newer.

1a: Check for (and install if missing) packages for "out-of-tree" modules
   development as required for your Linux distribution: usually 'gcc'
   and 'kernel-devel'. 

2: Unpack this RapidIO Driver Package into your working directory

3: Enter the package base directory and issue the following commands:
   - make clean
   - make all
   - make install (requires root privileges)
      NOTE: The install script does not overwrite existing configuration files
      named as ones in the 'config' directory to preserve user settings.
      If fresh installation of any of these files is required, the previous
      version must be deleted manually.

4: On *enumerating* node, edit /etc/modprobe.d/rapidio.conf file uncomment
   options line for rapidio module and assign RIO host destination ID
   (parameter hdid=). See Section 4 in Documentation/rapidio/rapidio.txt
   for more information about setting this parameter.
   
5: (OPTIONAL) The UDEV configuration file '70-rapidio-access.rules' assumes that
   char device drivers from this package will be accessed by users who are
   members of 'rapidio' user group (without asking for root privileges).
   To enable this option, on all nodes where this driver package is installed
   create 'rapidio' user group by using command "groupadd rapidio" or GUI
   utility provided with your Linux distribution.

6: (OPTIONAL) Add node users to group 'rapidio' as required.

7: (OPTIONAL) If reserved memory region will be used to allocate large DMA and
   inbound memory buffers, edit kernel boot command line to add parameter
   "memmap=" or "mem=" as required. Edit options line for rio_mport_cdev device
    driver according to your memory reservations. See example options setting
    in /etc/modprobe.d/rapidio.conf file.

8: Power cycle the entire cluster

9: As described in 'Documentation/rapidio/rapidio.txt' there are several methods
   to initialize RapidIO network numeration/discovery process. When configuring
   RapidIO initialization adjust module loading sequence controlled
   by /etc/modeprobe.d/rapidio.conf as required.
   Starting with the enumerating node, initiate enumeration/discovery process on
   each node (see command examples in comments for specific module loading
   options in rapidio.conf).

10: Confirm that RapidIO nodes have been enumerated (or discovered) by listing
   known devices in following path on each node:

   ls /sys/bus/rapidio/devices


III. Include Files
------------------

Include files that define user-space interface of RIO_CM (rio_cm_cdev.h)
and RIO_MPORT (rio_mport_cdev.h) device drivers are copied by the installation
script into two predefined locations common for all users:
- /lib/modules/`uname -r`/build/include/linux
- /usr/src/rapidio/linux

Include files will be updated every time when RapidIO drivers are installed.

IV. Synchronization with Upstream Mainline Linux Kernel Code Tree
-----------------------------------------------------------------

This package contains features and updates that are not committed to
the mainline repository but are planned for submission or have been submitted
but not accepted yet.

As the new code passes submission stages this package will be updated
accordingly to follow mainline as close as possible.
